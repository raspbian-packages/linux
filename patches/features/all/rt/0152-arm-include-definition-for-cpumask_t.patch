Subject: [PATCH 152/347] arm: include definition for cpumask_t
Origin: https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/rt/linux-stable-rt.git/commit?id=e1662dff1954d4e61f2af274c4be0c6c102988bf

This definition gets pulled in by other files. With the (later) split of
RCU and spinlock.h it won't compile anymore.
The split is done in ("rbtree: don't include the rcu header").
