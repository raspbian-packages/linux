Subject: x86/cpu: Avoid ABI change in 4.9.83
Forwarded: not-needed

The type of cpuinfo_x86::x86_cache_size was changed from int to
unsigned int, and the "unknown" value was changed from -1 to 0.  Only
one in-tree user of the field seems to have checked for the "unknown"
value, so this is probably not an ABI change in practice.  Just hide
the type change from genksyms.
