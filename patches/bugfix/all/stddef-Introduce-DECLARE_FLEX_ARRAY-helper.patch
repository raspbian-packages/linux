Subject: stddef: Introduce DECLARE_FLEX_ARRAY() helper
Origin: https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux-stable-rc.git/commit?id=ef8316e0e29e98d9cf7e0689ddffa37e79d33736

commit 3080ea5553cc909b000d1f1d964a9041962f2c5b upstream.

There are many places where kernel code wants to have several different
typed trailing flexible arrays. This would normally be done with multiple
flexible arrays in a union, but since GCC and Clang don't (on the surface)
allow this, there have been many open-coded workarounds, usually involving
neighboring 0-element arrays at the end of a structure. For example,
instead of something like this:

struct thing {
	...
	union {
		struct type1 foo[];
		struct type2 bar[];
	};
};

code works around the compiler with:

struct thing {
	...
	struct type1 foo[0];
	struct type2 bar[];
};

Another case is when a flexible array is wanted as the single member
within a struct (which itself is usually in a union). For example, this
would be worked around as:

union many {
	...
	struct {
		struct type3 baz[0];
	};
};

These kinds of work-arounds cause problems with size checks against such
zero-element arrays (for example when building with -Warray-bounds and
-Wzero-length-bounds, and with the coming FORTIFY_SOURCE improvements),
so they must all be converted to "real" flexible arrays, avoiding warnings
like this:

fs/hpfs/anode.c: In function 'hpfs_add_sector_to_btree':
fs/hpfs/anode.c:209:27: warning: array subscript 0 is outside the bounds of an interior zero-length array 'struct bplus_internal_node[0]' [-Wzero-length-bounds]

However, it _is_ entirely possible to have one or more flexible arrays
in a struct or union: it just has to be in another struct. And since it
cannot be alone in a struct, such a struct must have at least 1 other
named member -- but that member can be zero sized. Wrap all this nonsense
into the new DECLARE_FLEX_ARRAY() in support of having flexible arrays
in unions (or alone in a struct).

As with struct_group(), since this is needed in UAPI headers as well,
implement the core there, with a non-UAPI wrapper.

Additionally update kernel-doc to understand its existence.
