Subject: [PATCH 16/24] tty: tty_io: Show non-BKL consoles as active
Origin: https://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/projects/rt/6.5/older/patches-6.5.2-rt8.tar.xz

/sys/class/tty/console/active shows the consoles that are currently
registered and enabled and are able to print (i.e. have implemented
a write() callback). This is used by userspace programs such as
systemd's systemd-getty-generator to determine where consoles are
in order to automatically start a getty instance.

The non-BKL consoles do not implement write() but also should be
shown as an active console. Expand the conditions to also check if
the callbacks write_thread() or write_atomic() are implemented for
non-BKL consoles.
