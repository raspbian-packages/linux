Subject: [PATCH 214/323] sched: Limit the number of task migrations per batch
Origin: https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/rt/linux-stable-rt.git/commit?id=fcd1983df824454ba0ca0d6a79789c3f015ca506

Put an upper limit on the number of tasks which are migrated per batch
to avoid large latencies.
