Subject: tracefs: Fix potential null dereference in default_file_open()
Bug-Debian: https://bugs.debian.org/934304
Forwarded: https://lore.kernel.org/linux-security-module/20190812002833.2zij7tfsqtpvqu3a@decadent.org.uk/

The "open" operation in struct file_operations is optional, and
ftrace_event_id_fops does not set it.  In default_file_open(), after
all other checks have passed, return 0 if the underlying struct
file_operations does not implement open.

Fixes: 757ff7244358 ("tracefs: Restrict tracefs when the kernel is â€¦")
