Subject: fs: prevent use after free in auditing when symlink following was
 denied

commit ffd8d101a3a7d3f2e79deee1e342801703b6dc70 upstream.

Commit "fs: add link restriction audit reporting" has added auditing of failed
attempts to follow symlinks. Unfortunately, the auditing was being done after
the struct path structure was released earlier.
