Subject: [PATCH 360/397] futex: Split out the first waiter attachment from
 lookup_pi_state()
Origin: https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/rt/linux-stable-rt.git/commit?id=96c52672c220dc45f12a95dbe05d05a2f542bfec

upstream commit: 04e1b2e52b17195c9a1daa5935c55a4c8716095c

We want to be a bit more clever in futex_lock_pi_atomic() and separate
the possible states. Split out the code which attaches the first
waiter to the owner into a separate function. No functional change.
