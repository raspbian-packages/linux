Subject: drivers: usb: core: Don't disable irqs in usb_sg_wait() during URB
 submit.
Origin: https://git.kernel.org/linus/98b74b0ee57af1bcb6e8b2e76e707a71c5ef8ec9

usb_submit_urb() may take quite long to execute.  For example, a
single sg list may have 30 or more entries, possibly leading to that
many calls to DMA-map pages.  This can cause interrupt latency of
several hundred micro-seconds.

Avoid the problem by releasing the io->lock spinlock and re-enabling
interrupts before calling usb_submit_urb().  This opens races with
usb_sg_cancel() and sg_complete().  Handle those races by using
usb_block_urb() to stop URBs from being submitted after
usb_sg_cancel() or sg_complete() with error.

Note that usb_unlink_urb() is guaranteed to return -ENODEV if
!io->urbs[i]->dev and since the -ENODEV case is already handled,
we don't have to check for !io->urbs[i]->dev explicitly.

Before this change, reading 512MB from an ext3 filesystem on a USB
memory stick showed a throughput of 12 MB/s with about 500 missed
deadlines.

With this change, reading the same file gave the same throughput but
only one or two missed deadlines.
